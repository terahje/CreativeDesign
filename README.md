# CreativeDesign

## Description

The second project of 10 from a Udemy course called 10 Mega Responsive Websites. This project has an amazing landing page where the top resembles a wave. The cards are all custom with box shadows that really help them stand out. My favorite part is the contact section, where the image and form are slightly rotated. Paired with the hover effect, they really pop off the page.
